# Introduction

This dice app will allow players to easily roll D&D dice during a campaign.

## Background: What is D&D:

For people unfamiliar with D&D, D&D stands for dungeons and dragons and is a fantasy table-top role playing game. In the game players form a party and embark on epic quests as they explore a world or worlds together.

## What is the purpose of dice rolls?

In D&D players will use dice rolls for a wide array of features but the main applications can be boiled down to the following:

-Attack rolls (do you succesfully hit a target?)

-Skill checks and saving throws (Involves rolling a 20 sided die the higher you roll the more likely you are to be successful)

-Damage rolls (players are equipped with weapons which depending on what weapon they use will usually require a roll from a d6, d8, d10, or d12 die)
